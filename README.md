Cardstream iOS SDK
==================

Overview
---------
iOS SDK that can be used to allow the use of the Cardstream payment gateway within an iOS application.


Requirements
------------
CryptoSwift must be included as a Framework dependency. We have provided CryptoSwift v0.7.2 as part of our SDK however as part of good practice we encourage you to rebuild CryptoSwift and our iOS SDK before use.

**Please note that this repo is held for legacy integrations. New versions are being written to support mandated 3DSv2**
